Using Javascript and jQuery, build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch:

- Create a web page with a 16x16 grid of square divs
    - Create your divs using Javascript/jQuery. Don't try making them by hand with copy pasting
- Set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would
- Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (eg. 960px wide) and now you've got a new sketch pade
    - You should be able to enter 64 and have a new 64x64 grid pop up in front of you without changing the total amount of pixels used.
- Optional: Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
